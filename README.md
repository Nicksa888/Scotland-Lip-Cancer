# Scotland-Lip-Cancer
I estimate lip cancer in Scotland using standardized incidence ratios, generate relative risk estimates and quantify the effect of the AFF variable. I also show how to calculate exceedance probabilities of relative risk being greater than a given threshold value. Results are shown via tables, static plots, and interactive maps
